# Getting Started with `electron-react-app`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

The App will open with the DevTools panel open.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

For your ready electron app you will need to run the next command.

### `npm run dist`

Your App will be built to an installable `.exe` file in the `dist` folder.\
You will find your file (e.g. `electron-react-app Setup 0.1.0-beta.4.exe`) and a few other files in it.

**Note: You will need to change the `version` in `package.json` for publishing**
